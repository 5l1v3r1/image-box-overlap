To what extent are two images picturing the same 3D surfaces? Even when this is a known scene, the answer typically
requires an expensive search across scale space, with matching and geometric verification of large sets of
local features. This expense is further multiplied when a query image is evaluated against
a gallery, e.g. in visual relocalization. While we don‚Äôt obviate the need for geometric
verification, we propose an interpretable image-embedding that cuts the search in scale space to essentially a lookup.

Neural networks can be trained to predict a vector representations for images, such that the relative camera position between
pairs of images is approximated by a distance in vector space. And there are a few versions of such relations, that 
unfortunately are hard to interprete.

We propose to capture camera position relations through normalized surface overlap (NSO). 
NSO measure is not symmetric, but it is interpretable.

We propose to represent images as boxes, not vectors. Two boxes can intersect, and boxes can have different volumes.
The ratio of intersection over volume can be used to approximate normalized surface overlap. So, box representation
allows us to model non-symmetric (non-metric) relations between pairs of images. The result is that with box embeddings
we can quickly identify, for example, which test image is a close-up version of another.

Furthermore, the predicted normalized surface overlap can be used to derive relative scale factor between a pair of images.

Subsequently, local features need only be detected at that scale. We validate our scene-specific
model by showing how this embedding yields competitive image-matching results, while being simpler, faster,
and also interpretable by humans.
